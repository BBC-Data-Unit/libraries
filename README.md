This repository contains data used in the story 'Libraries lose a quarter of staff as hundreds close', collected through [Freedom of Information requests](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/libraries/blob/master/FOI_request.md) to library authorities across the UK. This data was complemented by analysis of [CIPFA reports](http://www.cipfa.org/services/statistics/comparative-profiles/public-libraries).

The story was reported across the BBC, including the following articles online:

## Other information

The House of Commons Library quoted the BBC research in its [briefing paper on public libraries on April 15, 2016](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05875). This briefing, which we have [uploaded to this repository](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/libraries/blob/master/HouseOfCommons%20Libraries%20Briefing%20SN05875.pdf), also includes data going back to 2005 and including a breakdown of different types of employees. Professional posts, for example, declined at a much faster rate (46% of positions going between 2010 and 2015) than other posts (25% over the same period).
