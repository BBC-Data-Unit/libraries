# Using the libraries data to explore data journalism

In this folder you will find a spreadsheet with the 3 main datasets from the BBC's' investigation into library cuts.

## Using sorting

Make sure you have the *Data* menu open. Click in one of the columns and use the *AZ* buttons (next to the *Sort* button) to sort the data by that column. Click once to bring the smallest values to the top, and again to bring the largest to the top. Alternatively, if you click the larger *Sort* button, or select *Data > Sort...* you will open a more advanced menu where you will need to specify the column you want to sort by and whether you want to sort from A to Z (smallest to largest) or Z to A (largest to smallest)

* What story can you tell about this view of the data?
* What questions do you need to ask next?
* Who do you need to contact to ask those questions?
* What other ingredients might you need to make this story stronger?

## Using filtering

Make sure you have the *Data* menu open. Click anywhere in the data, then click the large *Filter* button on the menu, or select *Data > Autofilter*.

Dropdown buttons should now appear at the top of each column.

Click on one of these dropdown menus and filter the data in some way. You can filter by searching for keywords, or selecting categories, or using the *Choose one* dropdown menu to select a range or criteria.
