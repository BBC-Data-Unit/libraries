# Original Freedom of Information request

The team spent a day with journalism students from Birmingham City University calling library authority press offices for information on closures. 

However, almost all those authorities asked that we submit our questions as a Freedom of Information request. These are the questions that we asked:

1.    How many library service points did you have in 2010? Do you have a list of addresses for those at all?
2      Please tell us how many library service points you have currently, November 2015, and provide the addresses.
3.  How many have been transferred from council control to the control of volunteers since 2010?
4.    Of those, which have had their opening hours reduced since 2010? And can you outline any changes please?
5.    Please tell us how many libraries have moved premises since 2010 and provide the former and current address.
6.    Please tell us how many new libraries have opened since 2010 (not existing libraries moving to different buildings) and provide addresses.
7.    How many library service points are proposed for closure within the next year? Please detail any mobile libraries separately to buildings
8.    How many members of staff worked for your libraries service in 2010 (headcount please, not FTE)?
9.    How many members of staff work for your libraries service (headcount please, not FTE) today?
10.  How many volunteers were assisting with the operation of the library service in 2010?
11.  How many volunteers assist with the operation of the library service today?
